# Family_Privacy_Dataset
    we establish datasets of different household scenes to check the system’s working capability in a real family environment.
    The datasets have seven categories of household scenes, namely, C1: taking a shower; C2: sleeping naked or semi-naked; C3: going to the toilet; C4: changing of clothes that shows a naked body; C5: someone not involved in the above privacy content; C6: nobody is at home; C7: privacy datasets that do not contain a home environment at all. 
    The training data include the following images:
    1) Images are collected independently by MAT’s 3D somatosensory in a real home environment, which is approximately 16% of the total images.  
    2) Images are collected from the Internet and screened and processed correctly in the home environment. The images have different scenes, objects, lights, angles, and pixels, which are approximately 52% of the total images. 
    3) Collected from other datasets like nsfw_data_scrapper [46], which involved visual privacy. Other privacy images of the home environment are not included, which are approximately 32% of the total images. 
    The training datasets consist of 8,720 images of 7 categories, and the test datasets contain 1,280 images, totaling 10,000 images.
